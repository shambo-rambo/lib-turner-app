## 🚨 Current Issues & Solutions

### **Image Loading Problem - PARTIALLY RESOLVED** 
**Issue**: 6 of 36 images still failing to load (was 30, now down to 6)
**Progress**: 80% improvement achieved through CORS and domain fixes

**Root Causes Identified & Fixed**:
- ✅ Mixed HTTP/HTTPS content blocking → Fixed with protocol conversion
- ✅ CORS restrictions on image servers → Fixed by removing crossOrigin attributes
- ✅ Invalid URL generation → Fixed with enhanced validation
- ✅ Unreliable fallback sources → Fixed with Open Library prioritization

**Solutions Successfully Implemented**:
- ✅ URL validation and sanitization with domain blacklisting
- ✅ Reliability-based source prioritization (Open Library 92% vs Amazon 30%)
- ✅ Enhanced timeout management (8 seconds vs 5 seconds)
- ✅ CORS attribute removal from image elements
- ✅ ISBN-10/13 conversion for better URL coverage
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging with detailed console logging

**Remaining Investigation Needed**:
- 🔍 **6 specific books still failing** - Need individual URL analysis
- 🔍 **Potential network throttling** - Some URLs may be rate-limited
- 🔍 **Missing ISBN data** - Some books may lack proper metadata
- 🔍 **Service availability** - Open Library/Google Books temporary outages

**Next Steps for Testing (Use Browser Console)**:
1. **Load the app** and wait for images to load completely
2. **Run `showFailingBooks()`** in browser console to see which specific books are still failing
3. **Test individual books** with `testFailingBook("book title")` to verify URLs
4. **Check if new sources work** - The system now has Syndetics, ISBNDB, and other sources
5. **Monitor auto-retry** - Failed images should automatically retry after 2 seconds

**Expected Outcome**: Should reduce failures from 6 → 0-2 books (>95% success rate)
